      <h1>Introduction to strings</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>
        A string is a data type in programming that is defined as a sequence of
        characters, it is implemented as an array of bytes (or words) that
        stores a sequence of elements, typically characters using some character
        encoding. <br />Depending on the programming language, strings can be of
        two types:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <b>Mutable strings:</b> Mutable strings are strings that can be
          modified. However, it depends on the declaration and the programming
          language.
        </li>
        <li>
          <b>Immutable strings:</b> Immutable strings are strings that cannot be
          modified, the string is unique. Making any changes to the string
          involves creating a copy of the original string and deallocating it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <h1>Operations on strings</h1>
      <p>Common string operations include finding the length, copying, concatenating, replacing, counting the occurrences of characters in a string. Such operations on strings can be performed easily with built-in functions provided by any programming language.</p>
      <p>Some of the standard operations involving strings: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Access characters:</b> Retrieving characters of the string. Similar to arrays, strings follow 0-based indexing. For example, S = “apple”, ‘a’ is the character at 0th index ( S[0] ), ‘e’ is the character at 4th index of the string S ( S[4] ).</li>
          <li><b>Concatenation:</b> Joining characters end to end, combining strings.For example:  S1 = “Hello ”, S2 = “World.”, the concatenation of strings S1 and S2 represented by S3 is S3 = S1+S2 => “Hello World.” , while S3 = S2+S1 => “World.Hello ”.</li>
          <li><b>Substring:</b> A contiguous sequence of characters in a string. For example, Substrings of the string “boy” are: “”, ”b”, ”o”, ”y”, ”bo”, ”oy”, ”boy” ( an empty string is also a substring ).</li>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Prefix:</b> A prefix is any leading contiguous part of the string. For example, S = “garden” - “”, “g”, ”ga”, ”gar”, ”gard”, ”garde”,  “garden” are all prefixes of the string S.</li>
              <li><b>Suffix:</b> A suffix is any trailing contiguous part of the string. For example, S = “garden” - “”, ”n”, ”en”, ”den”, ”rden”, ”arden”, ”garden” are all suffixes of the string S.</b></li>
          </ul>
      </ul>
      <p>NOTE: A string of length ‘N’ has (N * (N + 1)) / 2 substrings.</p>
      <h1>Applications of strings</h1>
      <ul><li>String matching algorithms, which involve searching for a pattern in a given text have various applications in the real-world.</li>
        <li>String matching algorithms contribute to efficiently implementing Spell checkers, Spam filters, Intrusion detection systems, plagiarism detection, bioinformatics, digital forensics, etc.</li></ul>
